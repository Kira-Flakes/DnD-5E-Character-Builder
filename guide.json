Wiz-Rad guides you through a series of questions that help you determine your character's race, class, ability scores, personality, and equipment. \n\n   With Wiz-Rad, you won't need to flip through rulebooks or worry about all the details. Instead, you'll focus on shaping your character's story and personality. \n\nYour character sheet will be filled out automatically as you answer questions about the role you want to play."

You may be large and intimidating, or small and unassuming. You may speak a common language, but be unable to communicate in certain areas of the world you may find yourself in. \n\nSome aspects of race are considered more useful than others. For example, Darkvision is a trait certain races possess, and it is considered one of the most powerful attributes. You’ll often find yourself in darkness. \n\nWe will make sure you have the option to choose these powerful traits."

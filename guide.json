        "class": "Class broadly describes a character's vocation and the tactics the character is likely to employ when exploring, fighting and negotiating. \n\n    Classes also determine the benefits you will receive. We will choose a class that receives benefits based on your preferred playstyle.",
        "ability scores": "Much of what your character can do is determined by your ability scores. The six abilities are Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.",
        "personality": "Once you have the basic game aspects of your character, you'll need to consider who your character is as a person. You'll give them a name, an alignment and background. Keep this in mind when answering questions.",
        "equipment": "With a good idea of who your character is, you can choose what they will need on their adventure. Equipment includes armor, weapons, gold and useful tools.",
        "character sheet": "A character sheet is used in tabletop role-playing games, like Dungeons & Dragons, to record and organize a player's character information. It includes details such as a character's name, race, class, abilities, skills, equipment, and backstory. Character sheets are essential for tracking a character's progress, abilities, and decisions throughout the game, serving as a reference point for players and game masters during gameplay.",
        "cultural background": "A character's cultural background in games like Dungeons & Dragons affects their personality, abilities, and role-playing interactions, adding depth to the narrative and influencing their alignment and moral choices. It contributes to worldbuilding and enriches the game's storytelling experience.",
        "bonuses": "For example, playing as a dwarf might provide bonuses to resilience or Constitution, while selecting a wizard class can grant bonuses related to spellcasting and intelligence. These racial and class-based bonuses can influence your character's strengths, weaknesses, and overall playstyle within the game, but you won't be restrcited to a playstyle based only on race.",
        "divine magic": "Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world.",
        "primary ability": "A primary ability is the ability that influences a class's special abilities. For example, for spell casters, the primary ability determines the highest spell level that can be cast.",
        "saving throws": "A saving throw, also called a save, represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character is at risk of harm.",
        "patrons": "testing",
        "alignment": "Alignment in a fantasy role-playing context reflects a character's moral and ethical compass, describing their beliefs and guiding principles. It is typically represented on two axes: the ethical axis (ranging from good to evil) and the moral axis (ranging from lawful to chaotic). This combination results in nine alignments, such as Lawful Good, Neutral Evil, or Chaotic Neutral, each defining a character's worldview and guiding their actions within a narrative.",
        "city secrets": "You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.",
        "military rank": "You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.",
        "ship's passage": "When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.",
        "researcher": "When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.",
        "wanderer": "You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.",
        "position of priviledge": "Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.",
        "discovery": "The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature.",
        "guild membership": "As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.",
        "by popular demand": "You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.",
        "criminal contact": "You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.",
        "false identity": "You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents, including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.",
        "shelter of the faithful": "As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.",
        "rustic hospitality": "Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.",
        "acrobatics": "The ability to perform agile and precise physical maneuvers, often involving balance and coordination.",

CTRL - Z for easier readability

The json guide has the following rules:

Symbol meanings:
'$' means we are describing a users set of possibilities.
    Example: $race means we are accessing the current set of races the player can choose from.
'%" means a set of all possible options, regardless of options the user has selected.

Question objects:

    Basic concept: To make this dynamic, we need to account for future changes. So I've structured the question sequence in the following way. Questions and answers are loaded to the html page.
    Structure:
    question -> q1 
                q2 
                ...
                qn 
    Rules:
    1. All answers must return a set representing the remaining possiblilities for the player.
        Example: Do you want a short character? "Yes" returns all short characters. "No" returns all tall characters. 



Sets:
    $race: [Dwarf,Elf,Tiefling,Dragonborn,Human,Half-Elf,Half-Orc,Halfling,Gnome]
